1. [traintrip](/1_traintrip/1_traintrip.md) (this is the grooviest)
2. [yo pierre!](/2_yo%20pierre!/2_yo%20pierre!.md) (this is the most convoluted)
3. [lemonrinse](/3_lemonrinse/3_lemonrinse.md)(this is the simplest)

## Program note
These pieces, conceived as preludes, were my capstone assignment for my Electronic Production and Design major. My goal was to create "serious"/academic electronic music that would have been accessible to my 16-year old self, who mostly listened to EDM growing up. 

The title came to me from reading Brad Mehldau's intimately written autobiography, Formation. A bildungsroman refers to a literary genre in which the journey of a protagonist from childhood to adulthood is documented. 

I used Max/MSP for all of the synthesis and composition. There are no VSTs or external plugins required. The pieces are generative, and slight variations in each rendering can be found.

## IMPORTANT: before opening the patches
* Prerequisites for opening the patches include- 
    * Installing rnbo guitar pedals, which can be found in the Package Manager in Max. 
    * Copy my instruments and tools into your Library folder in Max. This is found in your Documents folder.
    * Turn on Scheduler in Overdrive in Audio Status. 
    * Take a deep breath if you want to go through the patches, and good luck. :)
